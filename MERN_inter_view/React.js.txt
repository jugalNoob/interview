QWhat is React?
ANS:|/|React is a front-end JavaScript library that allows you to build user interfaces from reusable UI 
components. React uses server-side rendering to provide a flexible and performance-based solution.
It allows developers to create seamless UX and complex UI.

|/|_|\|Advantages of React JS

||React offers an easy debugging process. The code is reusable.
||It’s easy to learn because of its easy and simple design.
||It allows developers to migrate an app in React very easily.
||It supports both Android and iOS platforms.
||ReactJS is view-oriented.
||It has faster updates with both server-side and front-end support.
||It supports a React Native library that offers efficient performance.


3. What are the limitations of React?

The few limitations of React are as given below:

React is not a full-blown framework as it is only a library.
The components of React are numerous and will take time to fully grasp the benefits of all.
It might be difficult for beginner programmers to understand React.
Coding might become complex as it will make use of inline templating and JSX.




5. What are keys in React?

A key is a special string attribute that needs to be included when using lists of elements.

use array.map

not loop

Keys help react identify which elements were added, changed or removed.

Keys should be given to array elements for providing a unique identity for each element.

Without keys, React does not understand the order or uniqueness of each element.

6. What is JSX?

JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It allows us to write HTML inside JavaScript and place them in the DOM without using functions like appendChild( ) or createElement( ).

As stated in the official docs of React, JSX provides syntactic sugar for React.createElement( ) function.

Note- We can create react applications without using JSX as well.

7. What are the differences between functional and class components?

State and Lifecycle: Functional components were originally stateless and could not handle lifecycle methods. However, 

Component Structure: Functional components are typically simpler and more concise. They are focused on rendering UI based on the provided p

Code Organization: Functional components promote a more functional programming style and make it easier to separate concerns and reuse logic


8. What is the virtual DOM? How does react use the virtual DOM to render the UI?

As stated by the react team, virtual DOM is a concept where a virtual representation of the real DOM is kept inside the memory and is synced with the real DOM by a library such as ReactDOM.



15. What is React Hooks?
React Hooks are the built-in functions that permit developers for using the state and lifecycle methods within React components. These are newly added features made available in React 16.8 version. 


16. Explain React Hooks.
What are Hooks? Hooks are functions that let us “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from a functional component.

React Hooks cannot be used in class components. They let us write components without class.

19. Why do React Hooks make use of refs?

Earlier, refs were only limited to class components but now it can also be accessible in function components through the useRef Hook in React.


Managing focus, media playback, or text selection.
Integrating with DOM libraries by third-party.
Triggering the imperative animations.
20. What are Custom Hooks?

Qwhat is component?
ANS:|/| A piece of code that can resue like function
|/|but more powerfull than function
|/|2 type
|/|class and function component


21. Explain Strict Mode in React.
StrictMode is a tool added in version 16.3 of React to highlight potential problems in an application. It performs additional checks on the application.


23. What are the different ways to style a React component?
class RandomComponent extends React.Component {
 render() {
   return (
     <div>
       <h3 style={{ color: "Yellow" }}>This is a heading</h3>
       <p style={{ fontSize: "32px" }}>This is a paragraph</p>
     </div>
   );
 }
}


27. What are the different phases of the component lifecycle?

28. What are the lifecycle methods of React?
eact lifecycle hooks will have the methods that will be automatically called at different phases in the component lifecycle and thus it provides good control over what happens at the invoked point. It provides the power to effectively control and manipulate what goes on throughout the component lifecycle.

31. Differentiate React Hooks vs Classes.

It is used in functional components of React.

It will not require a declaration of any kind of constructor.

It does not require the use of this keyword in state declaration or modification.

It is easier to use because of the useState functionality.

React Hooks can be helpful in implementing Redux and context API.

34. What is React Router?
BrowserRouter: It is a router implementation that will make use of the HTML5 history API (pushState, popstate, and event replaceState) for keeping your UI to be in sync with the URL. It is the parent component useful in storing all other components.
Routes: It is a newer component that has been introduced in the React v6 and an upgrade of the component.
Route: It is considered to be a conditionally shown component and some UI will be rendered by this whenever there is a match between its path and the current URL.
Link: It is useful in creating links to various routes and implementing navigation all over the application. It works similarly to the anchor tag in HTML.
35. Can R


36. Explain conditional rendering in React.

Using if-else conditional logic which is suitable for smaller as well as for medium-sized applications
Using ternary operators, which takes away some amount of complication from if-else statements
Using element variables, which will enable us to write cleaner code

      <div>
        <input id={id + '-firstName'} type="text" />


Qwhat is virtualDom?
ANS:Virtual DOM is nothing but a strategy that React uses to optimize the performance of an 
application. It provides a mechanism that compares two render trees to know what exactly 
has changed and only updates what is necessary on the actual DOM.


Qreact use MVc?
ANS:models view controllReact isn't an MVC framework. React is a library for building composable
 user interfaces. While this is true, the term MVC framework is more of a marketing term. The original 
MVC concept is closer to a design pattern and has nothing to do with frameworks.



4. What is useState() in React?
ANS:|/|The useState() is a built-in React Hook that allows you for having state variables in functional
 components. It should be used when the DOM has something that is dynamically manipulating/controlling.

5. What are keys in React?

|/|Keys help react identify which elements were added, changed or removed.
|/|Keys are generally used for displaying a list of data coming from an API.



30. Explain about types of Hooks in React.

Basic Hooks:
useState(): This functional component is used to set and retrieve the state.
useEffect(): It enables for performing the side effects in the functional components.
useContext(): It is used for creating common data that is to be accessed by the components hierarchy without having to pass the props down to each level.

What are the differences between class components and functional components? 
ANS:Functional Components: Functional components are some of the more common components that will come 
across while working in React. These are simply JavaScript functions. We can create a functional
component to React by writing a JavaScript function.

||function_Component


import React, { useState } from "react";
 
const FunctionalComponent=()=>{
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);


    return (
        <div style={{margin:'50px'}}>

        </div>
    )
} 
 
export default FunctionalComponent;

||||////||||
Class Component: This is the bread and butter of most modern web apps built in ReactJS. These 
components are simple classes(made up of multiple functions that add functionality to the application).
