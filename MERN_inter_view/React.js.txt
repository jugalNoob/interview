QWhat is React?
ANS:|/|React is a front-end JavaScript library that allows you to build user interfaces from reusable UI 
components. React uses server-side rendering to provide a flexible and performance-based solution.
It allows developers to create seamless UX and complex UI.

application. It provides a mechanism that compares two render trees to know what exactly 
has changed and only updates what is necessary on the actual DOM.


Qreact use MVc?

..useDebugValue
..useDeferredValue
..useTransition
..useId

. Explain Strict Mode in React.
StrictMode is a tool added in version 16.3 of React to highlight potential problems in an 
application. It performs additional checks on the application.
  <React.StrictMode>
     <div classname="App">
       <Header/>
       <div>
         Page Content
       </div>

   </React.StrictMode>


import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";
const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(
<React.StrictMode>
  <App />

What are the differences between class components and functional components? 
ANS:Functional Components: Functional components are some of the more common components that will come 
across while working in React. These are simply JavaScript functions. We can create a functional
component to React by writing a JavaScript function.

||function_Component


import React, { useState } from "react";
 
const FunctionalComponent=()=>{
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);


    return (
        <div style={{margin:'50px'}}>
            <h1>Welcome to Geeks for Geeks </h1>

            <button onClick={increase}>Add</button>
        </div>
    )
} 
 
export default FunctionalComponent;

||||////||||
Class Component: This is the bread and butter of most modern web apps built in ReactJS. These 
components are simple classes(made up of multiple functions that add functionality to the application).

state and props hash been update with the same value;

5. Why use React instead of other frameworks, like Angular?

 |/|Easy creation of dynamic applications: React makes it easier to create dynamic web applications because
 it provides less coding and provides more functionality,
|/|Improved performance: React uses virtual DOM, which makes web applications perform faster. Virtual DOM compares

|/|Dedicated tools for easy debugging: Facebook has released a chrome extension that we can use to debug React applications


What is the difference between the ES6 and ES5 standards?
