zero Knowledge Proof + EVM


Qwhat is EVM?

Ans::smart contract --> solc compiler -> bytecode  -> EVM

Qwhat is EVM?

Ans:Thre ethereum virtual machine (evm) is a Decentralized virtual machine that executes smart contracts on the
EthereUm BlockChain it is the runtime environment Ethereum smart contract and is responsible for processing
 transaction and executing the code of smart contract



Qwhat is ZK?
ANS:â€¢ A zero-knowledge protocol is a method by which one party (the prover) can prove  to another party (the verifier) 
that something is true, without revealing any  information apart from the fact that this specific statement is true.

Q what is ZkSnark?
Ans::On-Chain Validation: Instead of processing each transaction separately on the main chain, the 
ZK-SNARK proof is validated on-chain to ensure the correctness of all the transactions within it.
This process significantly reduces the computational load on the main chain.


Aggregating Transactions: ZK Rollup collects multiple transactions off-chain, compresses them into a
single succinct proof called a ZK-SNARK (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge),
and submits this proof to the main Ethereum chain.


Q what is ZKStark ?
Ans::

Q what is ZKRollUp?
 Ans::Scalability and Cost Efficiency: By batching multiple transactions into a single proof, ZK Rollup
greatly increases the throughput of the Ethereum network. It allows for more transactions to be processed 
per block, improving scalability, and reduces transaction fees since the main chain only needs to verify 
the compact proof instead of individual transactions.
