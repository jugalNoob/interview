1::what is ethereum 


.ethereum is an open-sources blockchain platform

.node-ethereum - peer to peer 


type of node ->


1:full node

2:light node

3:archive node



full node is minor ethereum -> locally stores  a  copy of entire blockchain
->verifies and validates all the block


light node 
-> and trnsition 
->no ssd storgae

stores only the block header&index.depends on full node

for low capacity devies which cannot afford to store the gigabytes of data


archive node

stores everything kept in the full node and built an  archive of historical data



2:::account in ethereum

.an ethereum account is an entity with an ether (ETH) balance
that can send or receive transctions on ethereum



 type of ethereum accoun 

1:externally owned account (eoa)


create a wallet 
privat key --password

public key --email

send teanstion 

receive transation 

smart contract




2:contract account (CA)


contrat  account enter ethereum blockchain

::controlled by contract code.

::deploy smart contract in ethereum blockchain nad provider contract address



EOA

1:privated key is need

2:controlled by human


3:no gas is associated

4:has a unique address

5:holds eth balance

CA

1:no private or public key is need

2:controlled by contract code

3:gas is associated

4:has a unique address

5:holds ETH Balance





QDemo of eth block chain?

QWhat is Daos ?

ANS::decentralized autonomous organization

::contract code is if and else


:::DAO

.fully democratized

.voting required

.no trusted intermediary to count vote.

.services offered are handled automatically

.all activity is transparant and fully public.


:::A traditional organization

.usually hierarchical

.voting may or may not require

.outcome odf voting must be handles manually

.requires human handling , or centrally controlled automation.

.activity is typically private and limited to public



Qwhat is the DAO attack

::30.04.2016.live 
:: 15.05.2016.the dao raised over us100$ 
:: 16.06.2016.the dao is attacked problem in contract not ethereum blockchain
::17.06.2016.first proposal to counter the attack
::20.07.2016 hard forf completed




Qwhat is hardfork

ANS:: ethereum  classes old 

ethereum block  new blockchain block-no-1919999



..hardfork
.during a hard fork , software impplemnting a protocole and its mining
procedures is upgraded;

.once a user upgrade their software that version rejects all transations
from older software , effectively creating a new branch f the blockchain


.



Qwhat is softfork;

.soft forks are change to protocol , but the end product remains unchange

.a soft fork is a backward-compatible upgrade meaning that the upgrade nodes
can still communicate with non-upgrade ones;

.upgrade the blockchain and use  best  function;

.old nodes (not upgrade node)could still validate block and transaction (the

formatting) diidnot braek the rules)but they just wouldn't understand them;





Qwhat is pos and pow

ANS::ETH 2.0

.scalability
.security
.suntainibility


ETH 2 major upgrade

.proof of stack
.sharding

::pos

.it is validator --> system mini eth32
.work properl 


:::proof of work

.miners

.high performance hardware required

.lots of electricity required

.the more hashing power youe have the more

block you can validate


.competition

:::proof of stack

.validators

.mobile or laptop are enough

.not much electricity is required

.the more ETH you stake the more block you
can validate

.remdom selection is there;





Qwhat is sharding;


::network 1

::network 2

::network 3

.23major benfits

..transaction per second inerease
..powerful and expensive computer will not be needed
..more validators will join
..energy consumption will reduce

QBeacon + ethereum =>beacon chain + ethereum mainnet

::beacon chain + ethereum mainnet + shard chain = beacon chain + ethereum mainnet  + shard chain
