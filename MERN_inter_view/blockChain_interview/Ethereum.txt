An ERC-20 token is a type of digital asset or cryptocurrency that is built on the Ethereum blockchain, 
following a specific standard known as the ERC-20 standard. ERC stands for Ethereum Request for Comment, 
and 20 is the unique identifier for this particular standard.

1::what is ethereum 


.ethereum is an open-sources blockchain platform


Q types of node 

.node-ethereum - peer to peer 
It's a software client 

type of node ->


1::Full Nodes: Full nodes download and validate the entire Ethereum blockchain,

2::Light Nodes (or Light Clients): Light nodes do not download the entire blockchain. Instead,  ||| use for tranaction ||stor black header index block number

3::Archive Nodes: Archive nodes are a type of full node that not only store the current state of the blockchain but also maintain historical data,

4::Parity Nodes: Parity is one of the Ethereum client implementations  , and Parity nodes refer to nodes running this specific software client.

full node is minor ethereum -> locally stores  a  copy of entire blockchain 
->verifies and validates all the block


light node 
-> and trnsition 
->no ssd storgae

stores only the block header&index.depends on full node

for low capacity devies which cannot afford to store the gigabytes of data


archive node

stores everything kept in the full node and built an  archive of historical data



2:::account in ethereum  |||||||

.an ethereum account is an entity with an ether (ETH) balance
that can send or receive transctions on ethereum



 type of ethereum accoun 

1:externally owned account (eoa)


create a wallet 
privat key --password

public key --email

send teanstion 

receive transation 

smart contract

2:contract account (CA)


contrat  account enter ethereum blockchain

::controlled by contract code.

::deploy smart contract in ethereum blockchain nad provider contract address



EOA

1:privated key is need

2:controlled by human


3:no gas is associated

4:has a unique address

5:holds eth balance

CA

1:no private or public key is need

2:controlled by contract code

3:gas is associated

4:has a unique address

5:holds ETH Balance

Q what is samrt contract?

ANS: Code-Based: Smart contracts are written in programming languages tha

Immutable: Once deployed, smart contracts are generally immutable, meaning their code and terms cannot be
altered unless specifically designed to allow upgrades or changes.

Decentralized: Smart contracts are executed on a decentralized blockchain network, which ensures that there's no single point of failure or control.

Token Sales (ICO/STO): Raising funds by selling tokens to investors.
Supply Chain Management: Tracking the movement of goods and verifying their authenticity.
Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Automated lending, borrowing, and trading of digital assets.
Insurance: Automating the claims process based on predefined conditions.
Real Estate: Facilitating the purchase and transfer of property.
Voting: Secure and transparent voting systems.
Gaming: Implementing in-game assets and rules.



Qwhat etherum gas?
ANS::10*3-6=45 --> required gas 
-->update in smart smart contrat -- requira gas
-->deploy smart contract --require gass  price

/////////////////////
Gas price 

A ----->B
car ----->car

1gwei=10^9eth
1 gas price =1000 gwei
..The higher the gas price the faster the transaction will be  mined it
just like the transaction in bitcoin


2::Gas Limit 
..it is the maximum gas the transaction tranaction can consume 

transaction gas limit=21,000 uints 

21,000*100=210,000 gwei or 0.0021ETH

QWhat is Daos ?

ANS::decentralized autonomous organization

::contract code is if and else


:::DAO |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

Decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)

DAO is smart contract prgramming use a if else

.fully democratized

.voting required

.no trusted intermediary to count vote.

.services offered are handled automatically

.all activity is transparant and fully public.


:::A traditional organization

.usually hierarchical

.voting may or may not require

.outcome odf voting must be handles manually

.requires human handling , or centrally controlled automation.

.activity is typically private and limited to public



Qwhat is the DAO attack

::30.04.2016.live 
:: 15.05.2016.the dao raised over us100$ 
:: 16.06.2016.the dao is attacked problem in contract not ethereum blockchain
::17.06.2016.first proposal to counter the attack
::20.07.2016 hard forf completed




Qwhat is hard fork

ANS:: ethereum  classes old 

ethereum block  new blockchain block-no-1919999



..hardfork ||||||||||||||||||||||



.during a hard fork , software impplemnting a protocole and its mining
procedures is upgraded;

.once a user upgrade their software that version rejects all transations
from older software , effectively creating a new branch f the blockchain


.



Qwhat is softfork;

.soft forks are change to protocol , but the end product remains unchange

.a soft fork is a backward-compatible upgrade meaning that the upgrade nodes
can still communicate with non-upgrade ones;

.upgrade the blockchain and use  best  function;

.old nodes (not upgrade node)could still validate block and transaction (the

formatting) diidnot braek the rules)but they just wouldn't understand them;





Qwhat is pos and pow

ANS::ETH 2.0

.scalability  --> more tranaction 
.security  -->
.suntainibility  --> engary control 
.sharding  --> 

.POS  -->  validator  


ETH 2 major upgrade

.proof of stack
.sharding

::pos

.it is validator --> system mini eth32
.work properl 


:::proof of work

.miners

.high performance hardware required

.lots of electricity required

.the more hashing power youe have the more

block you can validate


.competition

:::proof of stack

.validators

.mobile or laptop are enough

.not much electricity is required

.the more ETH you stake the more block you
can validate

.remdom selection is there;





Qwhat is sharding;


::network 1  -- database

::network 2  --> database 

::network 3  --> dadtabase

.23major benfits

..transaction per second inerease
..powerful and expensive computer will not be needed
..more validators will join
..energy consumption will reduce

QBeacon + ethereum =>beacon chain + ethereum mainnet

::beacon chain + ethereum mainnet + shard chain = beacon chain + ethereum mainnet  + shard chain

13. What Is Wei? How Does It Differ from Ether?

Answer: Wei is the smallest unit in the Ether cryptocurrency that is used in the Ethereum network.

18. Tell Us About the Type of Ethereum Networks That Exist.

Answer: There are three types:

Private Network
Test Network, e.g., Rinkeby and Ropsten
Live Network, i.e., the main Network


19. How to Mine Ethers?

Answer: To mine ethers, one needs to have a wallet and tools such as Geth CLI. With it, you need to participate in the Network and help add transactions to the blocks.


26. What Is Block Time and Average Block Size in Ethereum?
Answer: The block time is  14 seconds., whereas the average block size is  2kb.


27. Can A Transaction Be Kept Hidden?
Answer: In the case of the public Ethereum network, no transactions can be kept hidden. All transactions are public.

30.What Is Geth?
Answer: Geth is a command-line interface used when running a full Ethereum node. Itâ€™s one of the best blockchain tools out there.
