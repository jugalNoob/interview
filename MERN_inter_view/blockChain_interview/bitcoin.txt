Wallet Core is a cross-platform library that implements low-level cryptographic wallet 
functionality for several blockchains. Most of the code is C++ with a set ...


Cold: The cold wallets refer to offline storage of bitcoins. These type of wallets are less convenient for frequent use, but they are more secure.
Hot: The hot wallets are connected to the internet most of the time. These type of wallets are suitable for daily use, but they are not secure.

Qwhat is HD wallet Hierachically deterministic wallet


Ans:you send bitcoin 
AND:::Master -->Private1 --> public1 --> Address1

second trantain --> private key2 --> public2 --> address2


Q what is public key or bitcion address?
Ans::Sending Transactions: You use your private key to sign transactions. The recipient uses your public key to verify the signature.

Receiving Transactions: You share your Bitcoin address (derived from your public key) with others. They send cryptocurrency to that address, and the associated public key is used to verify the transaction's authenticity.

Qwhat is mempool?

ANS::
The mempool, short for "memory pool," is a component of a blockchain network that temporarily holds 
unconfirmed transactions before they are included in a block and added to the blockchain. It serves as a 
staging area for pending transactions waiting to be validated and included in the next block by miners or
 validators. Here's how the mempool works:



1:Transaction Submission: When a user initiates a transaction on a blockchain network, such as sending 
cryptocurrency from one address to another, the transaction is first broadcasted to the network.



2::Mempool Inclusion: Once the transaction is broadcasted, it enters the mempool. The mempool is a data structure maintained by each participating node in the network, which keeps track of all the unconfirmed transactions.



3::Validation and Inclusion: Miners or validators, responsible for maintaining the network's security and 
consensus, select transactions from the mempool to include in the next block they are mining or 
validating. 


4::Confirmation and Block Inclusion: When a miner successfully mines a new block or a validator adds a new
 block to the blockchain, the selected transactions



5::Transaction Removal: After a transaction is included in a block, it is removed from the mempool of 
participating nodes since it is no longer pending






Qwaht is mining?

Transaction Validation: Miners collect unconfirmed transactions from the Bitcoin network's mempool. 


Block Formation: Miners group validated transactions into a block. Each block can contain a limited number of transactions, and there is a maximum block size (in bytes)


Proof-of-Work: Miners compete to solve a computationally intensive mathematical puzzle called the Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm. 


Mining Difficulty: The Bitcoin network adjusts the mining difficulty level approximately every two weeks to maintain an average block creation time of around 10 minutes. 



Block Confirmation: The miner who successfully finds the correct hash that satisfies the PoW criteria broadcasts their block to the network. 


Continuous Mining: Mining is an ongoing process, with new blocks added to the blockchain approximately every 10 minutes. 





Qwhat is what is the timestamp of 
bitcoin

Link ::: https://www.unixtimestamp.com/

Block Timestamp: The timestamp in Bitcoin is recorded in the header of each block. The block header

Timekeeping: The timestamp represents the time when the miner started the process of mining the block. It is typically set by the miner themselves, based on their local system clock. However, it's important 



Network Time: The Bitcoin network does not have a central authority or global clock to synchronize timestamps. Instead, it relies on a 


Difficulty Adjustment: The timestamp plays a role in the difficulty adjustment algorithm of Bitcoin. The difficulty level, which determines the computational effort required to mine a block, is adjusted 




Proof-of-Work Consensus: The timestamp, along with other components of the block header, is used as input for the proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm. Miners compete to find a hash value that meets
