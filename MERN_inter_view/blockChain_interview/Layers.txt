Consensus Mechanism:

(PoW)
(POS)

Security: Layer 1 blockchains are designed to provide a high level of security through cryptographic techniques and decentralized distribution of data.

Decentralization: 


2:::layer 2

crypto --> Polygon --> ARB  --> OPT

Lightning Network (Bitcoin): 

Rollups (Ethereum): Rollups are Layer 2 solutions for Ethereum that bundle multiple transactions into a single transaction, 

Polygon (formerly Matic Network): Polygon is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that offers a framework for building and connecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks.

Arbitrum (Ethereum): Arbitrum is a Layer 2 scaling solution that uses an optimistic rollup approach.

1:blockChain Trilema 

::three plary 

.scalable -->number transtion handle 

.secure --> blockchain important


.decentralize


2::CAP Theorem

.meaing of Cap use 2/3 only 

.like bitcoin --> not scalable  -->yes secure  --> secure

::Layer 2 refers to scaling solutions built on top of Layer 1 blockchains. These solutions aim to address the scalability limitations of Layer 1 by moving a significant portion of transaction

:::Smart Contracts: Layer 1 provides the infrastructure for executing smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with predefined rules and conditions. Smart contracts enable the creation of decentralized applications (DApps) and the execution of trustless transactions.

::Token Contracts: ERC-20 ::ERC-721
:: Identity Contracts: Identity contracts provide decentralized identity solutions on the blockchain. 
::Governance Contracts: Governance contracts facilitate decentralized decision-making and voting within a blockchain ecosystem.

::Transaction Validation and Verification: Layer 1 validates and verifies transactions, ensuring that they adhere to the rules and conditions of the blockchain protocol.
