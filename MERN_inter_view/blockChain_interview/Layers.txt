Consensus Mechanism:

(PoW)
(POS)

Security: Layer 1 blockchains are designed to provide a high level of security through cryptographic techniques and decentralized distribution of data.

Decentralization: 


2:::layer 2

crypto --> Polygon --> ARB  --> OPT

Lightning Network (Bitcoin): 

Rollups (Ethereum): Rollups are Layer 2 solutions for Ethereum that bundle multiple transactions into a single transaction, 

Polygon (formerly Matic Network): Polygon is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that offers a framework for building and connecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks.

Arbitrum (Ethereum): Arbitrum is a Layer 2 scaling solution that uses an optimistic rollup approach.

QWhat is layer?
ANS::

1:blockChain Trilema 

::three plary 

.scalable -->number transtion handle 

.secure --> blockchain important


.decentralize


2::CAP Theorem

.meaing of Cap use 2/3 only 

.like bitcoin --> not scalable  -->yes secure  --> secure

::Payment Channel Networks: Payment channel networks, such as the Lightning Network 
::Layer 2 refers to scaling solutions built on top of Layer 1 blockchains. These solutions aim to address the scalability limitations of Layer 1 by moving a significant portion of transaction 
.scalability <--> polygon faster transcation--

:::Smart Contracts: Layer 1 provides the infrastructure for executing smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with predefined rules and conditions. Smart contracts enable the creation of decentralized applications (DApps) and the execution of trustless transactions.

::Token Contracts: ERC-20 ::ERC-721
:: Identity Contracts: Identity contracts provide decentralized identity solutions on the blockchain. 
::Governance Contracts: Governance contracts facilitate decentralized decision-making and voting within a blockchain ecosystem. 
::crowdfund.sol

::Transaction Validation and Verification: Layer 1 validates and verifies transactions, ensuring that they adhere to the rules and conditions of the blockchain protocol.

.it is a prgram code of layer0

1 allow blockchain blackchains to interact with each other

2:faster and cheaper transactions.

3:infrasture for developer

4:includes the internet , hardware and connection

.it is not blockchain

.this is only code is called b-l-n


:::Payment channel

.multisignature 


.time Lock


example

::Raju || create  funding of transction  :: 1BTC          ||::Pinki

.second time not add block

example


0.99 BTC TO raju

0.01 BTC  to Pinki

.98 btc to raju

.0.02 btc to pinki
