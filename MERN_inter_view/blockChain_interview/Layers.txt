5::HardWare Layers



QWhat is layer?
ANS::

1:blockChain Trilema 

::three plary 

.scalable -->number transtion handle 

.secure --> blockchain important


.decentralize


2::CAP Theorem

.meaing of Cap use 2/3 only 

.like bitcoin --> not scalable  -->yes secure  --> secure





3:what is layers

::types of layer is 


||layer3|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||


.ui interface

.ux interface
Non-Fungible Token (NFT) Contracts: NFT

||layer2<-->important||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
::Payment Channel Networks: Payment channel networks, such as the Lightning Network 
::Layer 2 refers to scaling solutions built on top of Layer 1 blockchains. These solutions aim to address the scalability limitations of Layer 1 by moving a significant portion of transaction 
.scalability <--> polygon faster transcation--
.bitcoin lightning network
.big size of bitcoin blockchain
.onchain  and offchain

::lottery.sol
::staking.sol


||layer1||||||||||||||||||||||||||

:::Smart Contracts: Layer 1 provides the infrastructure for executing smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with predefined rules and conditions. Smart contracts enable the creation of decentralized applications (DApps) and the execution of trustless transactions.

::Token Contracts: ERC-20 ::ERC-721
:: Identity Contracts: Identity contracts provide decentralized identity solutions on the blockchain. 
::Governance Contracts: Governance contracts facilitate decentralized decision-making and voting within a blockchain ecosystem. 
::crowdfund.sol
.secuirty

::Transaction Validation and Verification: Layer 1 validates and verifies transactions, ensuring that they adhere to the rules and conditions of the blockchain protocol.

.example - pow.pos etc



||layer0 fundcumation||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

.it is a prgram code of layer0

1 allow blockchain blackchains to interact with each other

2:faster and cheaper transactions.

3:infrasture for developer

4:includes the internet , hardware and connection









4:bitcoin Lightning Network

.it is not blockchain

.this is only code is called b-l-n


:::Payment channel

.multisignature 


.time Lock


example

::Raju || create  funding of transction  :: 1BTC          ||::Pinki

.second time not add block

example


0.99 BTC TO raju

0.01 BTC  to Pinki

.98 btc to raju

.0.02 btc to pinki


settle transction 

.this transcation add code 

0.6 btc to raju

0.4 btc to pinki
