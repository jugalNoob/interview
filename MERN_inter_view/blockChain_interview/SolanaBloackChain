Q What is Solana ?

Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform designed for decentralized applications and cryptocurrencies.
It was created to address some of the
scalability and throughput limitations that earlier blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum and Bitcoin, have faced. 

Types :::High Throughput: Solana is known for its high transaction throughput. It achieves this through a unique consensus mechanism 
called Proof of History (PoH) in combination with the traditional 


Scalability::::Solana is designed to scale horizontally, meaning it 
can handle more transactions by adding more nodes to the network. 


Smart Contracts::: Solana supports smart contracts, similar to Ethereum. Developers can build decentralized applications (dApps) 

SOL Token: SOL is the native cryptocurrency of the Solana network. It is used for transaction fees, staking, and as collateral
for various DeFi (decentralized finance) applications built on Solana.
