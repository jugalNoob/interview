Documentation is required.

22. How Does Blockchain Create Blocks?


::::When the block size is reached, the blockchain creates blocks automatically. Since the block is a file, the transactions are saved until the file is complete. They are linked in such a way that the most recent block is connected to the previous one. A hash value is created using a mathematical function to identify a block. It also shows any modifications made to a block.


23. Can Anyone Remove Blocks from A Blockchain?

The manner in which blocks are removed from a blockchain is entirely dependent on how they are treated. Manually removing a block is not possible. If it is destroyed, however, the blockchain may attempt to restore the database using other peers.


24. What is encryption? What is its role in Blockchain?
Encryption is a technique that is used to keep the data secure.  The data is encoded to some level before being sent out of a network by the sender in this process. Only the receiver will be able to decode it. This approach is useful in Blockchain because it simply adds to the overall protection and validity of blocks, making them more stable.

50. What Is Consensus Algorithm?\
The method of gaining consensus on a change of data over the system or any distributed network is known as a consensus algorithm. They are widely used in blockchains because they enable the network of unknown nodes to reach consensus on the data that is being stored or shared. Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Work(PoW) are the most popular consensus algorithms.


49. What is Transparent and incorruptible in blockchain?

Every ten minutes, the blockchain network checks in with itself to ensure that it is in a state of consensus. The network, which functions as a self-auditing ecosystem of digital value, reconciles any transaction that occurs in ten-minute intervals. A “block” refers to a collection of these transactions. As a result, two critical properties emerge from this they are:


47. What Are the Drawbacks of Blockchain?

Some Blockchain Solutions Use So Much Energy Because Blockchain Isn’t a Distributed Computing System
It’s difficult to incorporate and manage complex technologies.
There are also problems with scalability.
Data is unchangeable.
It can be inefficient at times because network speed and transaction costs fluctuate.
Human error has not yet been eradicated.
Not entirely secure.


46. What is a Private Key?

A private key is an alphanumeric term that is used to encrypt and decrypt data associated with a public key. In blockchain security, It is also a component of the cryptographic algorithms. The key has been allocated to the key generator and can only be used by him. If he fails to do so, someone can gain access to the wallet’s information or data, as well as the address for which the private key is stored.


45. What is a Public Key?
The cryptographic algorithm that enables peers in a blockchain to obtain funds in their wallet uses a public key. A pair of keys is created when a public key is connected to a private key. The private-public key pair is used to ensure that the blockchain’s security is maintained. A public key is a string of alphanumeric characters that is unique to a specific node or address.\
