Q:what is RestAPI

ANS::Representational state transfer Application
Programming Interface


..it is software that allows two application to communicate with each
other over the internet and  through various devices every time you access 
an app like facebook or check the weather on your smartphone an API used




create--post

Read-- get

update - putch-put

delete -- 

Which Template Engines Does Express Support
Express supports any template engine that conforms with the (path, locals, callback) signature.


Q.44What is Scaffolding in Express.js
Scaffolding is creating the skeleton structure of application. There are 2 way to do this: Express
 application generator and Yeoman

Q.42Explain the process of Sharding.
Sharding is the process of splitting data up across machines. We also use the term “partitioning” sometimes
 to describe this concept. We can store more data and handle more load without requiring larger or more powerful
 machines, by putting a subset of data on each machine.


Q.41How do you Delete a Document in MongoDB
The CRUD API in MongoDB provides deleteOne and deleteMany for this purpose. Both of these methods take a filter
 document as their first parameter. The filter specifies a set of criteria to match 
against in removing documents.


Q.36How to make node modules available externally
module.export



Q.34Explain the concept of stub in Node.js
Stubs are used in writing tests which are an important part of development. It replaces the whole function which 
is getting tested.




What are node.js buffers?
In general, buffers is a temporary memory that is mainly used by stream to hold on to some data until consumed.
 Buffers are introduced with additional use cases than JavaScript’s Unit8Array and are mainly used to represent a 
fixed-length sequence of bytes. This also supports legacy encodings like ASCII, utf-8, etc. 



Q30List down the two arguments that async.queue takes as input in Node.js?
Task Function and Concurrency Value


Q29What is REPL In Node.Js?

REPL or “Read Eval Print Loop” is a simple program that can accept commands, evaluate them, and prints the results.
 What REPL does is to create an environment that is similar to a  Unix/Linux shell or a Window console




Q28))What's the difference between a "smart" component and a "dumb" component?
Smart components manage their state or in a Redux environment are connected to the Redux store. Dumb components are driven completely by their props passed in 
from their parent and maintain no state of their own.




Q.19What is Sharding in MongoDB
Sharding is a method for storing data across multiple machines. MongoDB uses sharding to support deployments with very large data sets and high throughput operations.


Q.18What is ReactDOM
It's a top-level React API to render a React element into the DOM, via the ReactDOM.render method.


Q.6What is Callback Hell
The asynchronous function requires callbacks as a return parameter. When multiple asynchronous functions are chained together then callback hell situation comes up.



What is the MERN stack?
Explain the role of each component in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).

What is virtual DOM in React and how does it work?
Explain the concept of components in React.

Explain the concept of middleware in Express.js.
What is the role of MongoDB in the MERN stack?
What is Mongoose and why is it used with MongoDB?
How does Node.js fit into the MERN stack?
Explain the concept of non-blocking I/O in Node.js.
1:Event Loop: Node.js uses an event-driven, single-threaded architecture with an event loop at its core. The event loop is responsible for handling and 
2::Callbacks: Node.js uses callbacks to handle the results of non-blocking operations. Instead of blocking the execution until an operation completes,
3::Asynchronous APIs: Node.js provides a rich set of asynchronous APIs for performing I/O operations, such as reading and writing files, making HTTP requests, or querying 
4::Event-driven Programming: Node.js follows an event-driven programming paradigm, where events are emitted when certain actions occur
5::Single-threaded Event Loop: In a single-threaded environment, Node.js utilizes the event loop to efficiently manage I/O operations.

What is npm and how is it used in the MERN stack?
How can you secure a MERN stack application?
Explain the concept of authentication and authorization in a MERN stack application.

:Authentication:

1::User Registration: Users create an account by providing their credentials, such as username and password. 
The application securely stores this information,

2::User Login: Users provide their credentials (username/email and password) to log into the application. 
The application verifies the provided information against the stored user 

3::Authentication Middleware: In the backend (Node.js/Express.js), authentication middleware is
 used to validate the user's session or token for protected routes.



 :::::::Authorization:
Authorization is the process of granting or denying access to specific resources
 or functionalities within the application based on the user's permissions. It ensures that authenticated users have appropriate access rights.
 In a MERN stack application, authorization involves the following steps:


1::User Roles and Permissions: User roles define the level of access and permissions a user has within the application.
 For example, an administrator might have full access, while a 

2::Authorization Middleware: In the backend (Node.js/Express.js), authorization middleware is used to check
 if the authenticated user has the necessary permissions to access a 


3::Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): RBAC is a common approach to implement authorization. It defines the permissions associated with each role and allows the application to grant or deny access to specific
  routes, API endpoints, or functionality based on the user's role.
