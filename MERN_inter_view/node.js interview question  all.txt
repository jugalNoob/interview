Sure! Here are some commonly asked Node.js interview questions:

1::What is Node.js?
Node.js is an open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to build scalable and high-performance applications. It is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript 
engine and provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model.


...Node.js is a Runtime Env for Javascript



..You can run js outside of the browers

..Javascript can talk to native machine because of C++

.. You can create webservers in javscript  language
const http = require('http');
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
  res.end('Hello, World!\n');
});
const port = 3000;
server.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}/`);
});


..Client side vs server side

::::Clent Side
...Runs in the User's Browser: Client-side code, typically written in languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, is executed in the user's web browser.

..User Interface

..Fast Response: Client-side processing provides faster responses t

..Examples: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and front-end frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js.


::Servee Side

...Runs on the Server: Server-side code is executed on a remote server, not in the user's browser.
...usiness Logic: It's responsible for processing data, performing business logic, and interacting with databases
...Secure: Server-side code can perform sensitive operations and is generally more secure as it's not visible or accessible to users.
...Slower Response: Server-side processing can introduce latency because it often requires network requests from the client to the server and back.

Q what is Modules
In Node.js, modules are a fundamental part of the CommonJS module system, which allows you to organize your JavaScript code into reusable 
and encapsulated units. Node.js uses the require function to load and use modules, and you can create your own modules to structure your application.

Q what is node.js Architecture

Ans:: Client  -->send Request  -->Node.sj server




2:::What is the difference between Node.js and JavaScript?

Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server-side, while JavaScript is a programming language that can be used both on the client-side (in web browsers) 
and server-side (with Node.js).


3::Explain the concept of the event-driven architecture in Node.js.

Node.js follows an event-driven architecture, where certain events trigger callbacks to be executed. It uses an event loop to handle and dispatch events, allowing it to handle many concurrent 
connections without blocking.


4::What is npm?
npm (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js. It is used to install, manage, and share reusable \
JavaScript code packages/modules.


5::How does Node.js handle asynchronous operations?
Node.js uses callbacks, Promises, and async/await to handle asynchronous operations. Callbacks are the traditional way of handling asynchronous tasks, while Promises and async/await provide more readable and structured 
ways of dealing with asynchronous code.


6::What is the purpose of the package.json file in a Node.js project?
The package.json file contains metadata about a Node.js project and lists its dependencies, scripts, and other configurations. It is also used by npm to manage
 packages and their versions.


7::How does error handling work in Node.js?

In Node.js, errors can be handled using try-catch blocks for synchronous code. For asynchronous operations, errors can be handled through callbacks, Promises, 
or by using the catch method with async/await.


8::What is the purpose of the exports object in Node.js?

The exports object is used to expose functions, objects, or values from a Node.js module. It allows other modules to consume
 and use those exported entities.


9::Explain the concept of middleware in Express.js.


Middleware functions in Express.js are functions that have access
 to the request and response objects in the application's request-response cycle. They can modify the request or response, terminate the request-response cycle, or 
call the next middleware function in the stack.
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Custom middleware function
const logger = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Incoming request');
  next(); // Call the next middleware function
};

// Global middleware - will be executed for every request
app.use(logger);

// Route handler
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});


10::How can you handle concurrent requests in Node.js?

Node.js is inherently designed to handle concurrent requests efficiently due to its non-blocking, event-driven nature. The event loop allows it to process multiple requests simultaneously 
without blocking other requests.


1::
In Express.js, there are several common HTTP status codes
200 - OK:
This status code indicates that the request has been successfully processed.
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).send('OK');
});

201 - Created:
This status code indicates that a new resource has been successfully created.


app.post('/users', (req, res) => {
  // Create a new user
  // ...
  res.status(201).send('User created');
});


400 - Bad Request:
This status code indicates that the server cannot process the request due to invalid syntax or parameters.


app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
  if (!req.query.name) {
    res.status(400).send('Name parameter is required');
    return;
  }
  // Process the request
  // ...
});

404 - Not Found:
This status code indicates that the requested resource could not be found on the server.

app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  const user = findUserById(req.params.id);
  if (!user) {
    res.status(404).send('User not found');
    return;
  }
  res.send(user);
});

500 - Internal Server Error:
This status code indicates that an unexpected error occurred on the server.
app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Perform some operation that throws an error
    // ...
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    res.status(500).send('Internal Server Error');
  }
});

15::express headers 
with code
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.set({
    'Content-Type': 'text/html',
    'Cache-Control': 'no-cache',
    'X-Custom-Header': 'Custom Value'
  });
  res.send('<h1>Hello, World!</h1>');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});


Certainly! Here's an example of setting multiple headers in Express.js:

javascript
Copy code
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.set({
    'Content-Type': 'text/html',
    'Cache-Control': 'no-cache',
    'X-Custom-Header': 'Custom Value'
  });
  res.send('<h1>Hello, World!</h1>');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});


7:::How can you handle errors in Express.js?
Express.js provides error handling middleware to handle errors. Here's an example of error handling middleware:
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Route handler
app.get('/', (req, res, next) => {
  // Generate an error
  const error = new Error('Something went wrong');
  next(error);
});

// Error handling middleware
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err);
  res.status(500).send('Internal Server Error');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});


In this example, we define a route handler for the root URL ("/"). When a GET request is made to the root URL, the res.set method is used to set multiple headers at once.

The 'Content-Type' header is set to 'text/html' to indicate that the response body contains HTML content.

The 'Cache-Control' header is set to 'no-cache' to instruct the client or intermediate proxies not to cache the response.

The 'X-Custom-Header' is a custom header that is set to 'Custom Value' in this example. You can replace it with your own custom header and value.

Finally, the res.send method is used to send the response, which includes the HTML content <h1>Hello, World!</h1>.

You can add or modify the headers based on your specific requirements by using the res.set method.




Q what is Header in Node.js 

Flaviocopes.com /http-request-headers/

Ans :::Common Headers:
Content-Type: Specifies the type of data in the request or response body (e.g., JSON, HTML, text).

Content-Length: Indicates the size of the content in the request or response body.

User-Agent: Identifies the client application making the request. ///check which application use chorme opera 

Authorization: Contains credentials to authenticate the client.

Cache-Control: Directives to control caching behavior.

Appect /// json html

app.get("/api", (req, res) => {
    ///cerate  custom Header
    res.setHeader("X-MyName" , "jugal shat")
    ///TODO - 
    
    console.log(req.headers);
    // Set a custom response header named "my-name" with the value "jugal"
    res.setHeader("my-name", "jugal");
    // Send a response back to the client with a message
    res.send("Response with custom header set");
});








Q  what is Http methods?

Ans::GET: Used to request data from a specified resource. This method only retrieves data and does not modify it on the server.

POST: Sends data to a server to create or update a resource. It often submits data like form inputs to the server.

PUT: Updates a specified resource with the provided data. It replaces the entire resource if it exists or creates a new resource if it doesn't.

DELETE: Removes the specified resource.

PATCH: Applies partial modifications to a resource. It's used to update specific fields in the resource without affecting the entire resource.

HEAD: Similar to GET but only retrieves the response headers and not the actual content of the resource. It's useful for checking the validity of links, tracking changes, etc.

OPTIONS: Requests information about the communication options available for the target resource. It's used to describe the communication options for the target resource.

TRACE: Echoes back the received request to the client, allowing clients to see what is being received at the server end. It's mostly used for diagnostic purposes.

CONNECT: Converts the request connection to a transparent TCP/IP tunnel. It's used for establishing a network connection to a server through a proxy.


Q what is Streams ?

Text --> Data Ram  --> Res send

File --> check --> Browser



//stream Read (smaple.txt) --> Zipper --> Fs Write Stream
fs.createReadStream("./one.txt").pipe(
zlib.createGzip().pipe(fs.createWriteStream("./one.txt")))

const express = require("express");
const fs = require("fs"); // Import the 'fs' module
const app = express();
app.get("", (req, res) => {
    res.send("jugal");
});
app.get("/stream", (req, res) => {
    const stream = fs.createReadStream("./one.txt", "utf-8"); // Correct 'uft-8' to 'utf-8'
    stream.on('data', (chunk) => res.write(chunk));
    stream.on('end', () => res.end()); // Use res.end() to complete the response
    stream.on('error', (err) => res.status(500).send(err)); // Handle errors if the file cannot be read
});
app.listen(9000, () => {
    console.log("Server running on port 9000");
});
